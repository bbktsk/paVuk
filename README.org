* paVuk, a RISC-V implementation by a complete n00b

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Dedicated to Marek "Pavuk" Antozi, who had to audacity to die before I
got a chance to brag about my own RISC-V CPU.
#+END_QUOTE

This is my attempt at simple RISC-V Verilog implemenation. Note that I
know basically nothing about Verilog, CPU design and a lot of other
related stuff, so you should definitely not learn from this. Continue
at your own risk.

For more detailed story of this project, see [[https://bbktsk.io/][my blog]].

** Target device

Lattice ECP5. Specifically, LFE5U-85F-6BG381C (caBGA, 381 pins, 84k
LUTs) in Radiona ULX3S.

** Setup

On Arch Linux, I have installed the following packages:

- =iverilog-12.0-2= for running tests
- =verilator-5.034-1= to make =flycheck= in =emacs= work
- =openfpgaloader-0.13.1-1= to upload =.bit= to the device
- =gtkwave-3.3.121-1= to view recordings from tests
- =riscv64-linux-gnu-{binutils,gcc}= for compiler, assembler and
  related tools.

As =nextpnr= is not available as a regular package, these are
installed from AUR:

- =prjtrellis-nightly=
- =yosys-nightly=
- =nextpnr-ecp5-nightly=

Some python test code also requires =numpy=, that's =python-numpy= on
Arch.
